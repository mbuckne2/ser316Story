Last year, I went on a summer vacation to visit Berlin for the first time.
One of my favorite parts of the vacation was trying German cuisine, where the bratwurst was delicious.
I found Melhase at the baeckerei eating all of the brot!
I then left the baeckerei in my BMW and made my way to the flughafen.
I then saw a sign for a Ratskeller, so I pulled over to go in.
On my way in, I saw a hungry Hund so I gave it some Brot from the baeckerei.
The hund thought I was mad chill because of that so it let me ride in its Porche.
I turned on the klimaanlage and the hund got up close and personal to feel the breeze.
The hund wanted to go and see Eltz Castle, so we drove there on the autobahn, listening to Rammstein.
I put my lederhose back on before we get out and we both head down the Hauptstrasse.
After the day was done, I went into my Schloss, had some Gebaeck and went to sleep.
